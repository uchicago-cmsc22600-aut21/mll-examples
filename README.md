# ML Lite Example Programs

This source repository contains a number of small ML Lite programs (in the
`examples` subdirectory).  It will also contain sample outputs from the
reference implementation.

  * `tokens` contains the Project 1 sample outputs

  * `parse-trees` contains the Project 2 sample parse-tree outputs.  These outputs
     do **not** include the source location marks.

  * `bind-trees` contains the Project 2 sample bind-tree outputs.
