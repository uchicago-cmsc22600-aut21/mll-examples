# ML Lite Example Programs

This source repository contains a number of small ML Lite programs (in the
`examples` subdirectory).  It will also contain sample outputs from the
reference implementation.

  * `tokens` contains the Project 1 sample outputs

  * `parse-trees` contains the Project 2 sample parse-tree outputs.  These
     outputs do **not** include the source location marks.

  * `bind-trees` contains the Project 2 sample bind-tree outputs.

  * `ast` contains the Project 3 sample typed AST outputs.

  * `simple` contains the Project 4 sample SimpleAST outputs before let floating

  * `simple-let` contains the Project 4 sample SimpleAST outputs after let floating

  * `cfg` contains the Project 4 sample CFG outputs

  * `llvm` contains the Project 4 sample LLVM outputs.  Note that it is highly
    unlikely that your output will be the same as the sample output at this point.
